-- Notes to Translators:
--   - You will have to create a copy of this file and change it's name to your language. Then translate stuff in that file.
--     List of languages and resulting file names:
--       German: ui_de.lua
--       French: ui_fr.lua
--       Russian: ui_ru.lua
--       Japanese: ui_jp.lua
--       Spanish: ui_es.lua
--       Portuguese: ui_br.lua
--       Polish: ui_pl.lua
--   - /n is newline. It might not work/diplay correctly in all entries. Tooltips should be safe.
--   - %s %d are substitution commands that Addon will replace with dynamic values. They need to stay in translation!
--   - |c ... |r is for coloring text. They need to stay in translation!
--   - Tables/Lists marked "LOOP" are displayed via for loop.  Meaning you can add/remove lines if advantageous for translation
--     If you need to add lines for one not marked loop try /n for newline inside the string
--     If you hit a wall with /n. Let me know. Some additional ones could be changed to LOOP implementation
--   - A lot of UI Elements are fixed width and rather narrow. I know might make translating hard. Please try to fit. 
--     Worst come worst. I might be able to make dimensions as part of the language files. But this would be quite some work I fear. Please try to fit.
--   - Working iterative might be time consuming (Translate some values. Save. /reloadui in game). But safer. 
--     Changing a hundred things. Then /reloadui and nothing works anymore. And trying to figure out which of the 100 changes was the culprit is not pleasant.
